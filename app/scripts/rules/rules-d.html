    <p>When a player lands on a "cool" space, a random card
        is drawn. If it's cool, that player will either stay on that space or advance to the next "pass". If it's not
        cool, that player will go to "work", "school", "jail", or return home.</p> </b>

        player must land exactly on the "?"s "pass" to continue. If a player overshoots the "pass" or "win", that player
